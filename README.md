Welcome to Eat-da-Burger! I hope you're hungry! We can make any sandwich you could possibly
dream of! If what you want is not currently on the menu, add it! Our cashier interface will allow
any combination you want, process your order, and relay it back to you once it is ready to eat!
Once your order is ready, DEVOUR it!



My app uses MySQL for database needs, Handlebars for UI, and Javascript for processing. I utilize
ORMs to communicate with the database.

    *** You will need your own .env file and MySQL credentials, as I will not be providing mine in this app.
